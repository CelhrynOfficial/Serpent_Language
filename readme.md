**Serpent** is a programming language based on Python, designed to allow developers to write their code entirely in French. By replacing Python’s English syntax and keywords with their French equivalents, Serpent makes programming more accessible to native French speakers and offers a unique way to explore the world of coding.

## Why Serpent?

While Python is known for its readability and simplicity, it is still tied to English. Serpent takes the elegance of Python and translates it into French, providing a familiar experience for French-speaking programmers or anyone interested in learning a programming language with a twist.

## Features

- **Complete French Syntax**: All Python keywords are translated into French.
- **Supports Python Libraries**: Serpent is fully compatible with existing Python libraries.
- **Readable and Simple**: Maintains Python's reputation for clean and easy-to-understand code, just in French.
- **Interactive Interpreter**: Write and execute your French Python code in an interactive environment.

## Example Code

Here’s a simple example of what Serpent code looks like:

```serpent
definir bonjour_monde():
    imprimer("Bonjour, monde !")

si __nom__ == "__principal__":
    bonjour_monde()
```
